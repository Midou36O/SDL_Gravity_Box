# SDL_Gravity_Box
Making a "windowed" 2D box that makes the ball move when moving the window (just like an actual box in real life!)

# Why do i make this
Because i absolutely fucking hate myself and i have to make something like that for a game (not free) i'm planning to code after exams.

_**Just consider this repo a sandbox for shit i make lol**_
